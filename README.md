### Project Description:

For our project, we would like to create a one-stop shop for MARTA users. MARTA (Metro-Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) is the city of Atlantaâ€™s main mode of public transportation. The train and bus routes follow the 285 and 120 interstates around the Metro-Atlanta area. Currently, MARTA has two mobile apps, one for purchasing tickets and another for train routes. They also have a web app called Marta.io, which shows the train schedules and status in real-time. However, this is tedious and inefficient. Users should not have to juggle 3 different tools in order to utilize MARTA more efficiently. Thus, our team sets out to create a web app that will allow MARTA users to view train schedules and updates in real-time, purchase tickets (mock-up), and locate their nearest train station.
